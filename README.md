Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yisak zemedu

I am a software developer from Arbamunchi Unverstiy with interest for building immersive experiences and interactive applications. I have specialized in MERN stack, where I combine my skills in frontend and backend development to create dynamic and scalable web applications. With a high interest in web development, I love creating web assets and reusable components. Whether it's Full stack web, coding web mechanics or optimizing performance, I'm always up for challenging myself.
